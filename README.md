The data in all 3 of them is the same and it is a set of 3D MRI scans of the patients brains.

Tasks:
- Project 1 (regression): find out the patient's age.
- Project 2 (classification) find out if patiend is ill.
- Project 3 (multi-class classification): find out if patient is young, if ill and gender

Submitted code and description should be in folder `best_[1-3]` but since it is missing for project 2, try to check ML16/Project2.
